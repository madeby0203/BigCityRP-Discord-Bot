## Hi
To start off, I will briefly explain some stuff. The bot as it is posted here, misses the admin extension (cog). It needs some further improvements before I'll post it. In addition to that I should probably also tell you that this doesnt work out of the box. The bot is made custom for the BigCityRP community and is therefor not made to quickly implement in a different server. I will be working on some easier configuration for the bot down the road

Also, especially the main file is really messy, and I'm going to be working on that. It has been the file I started with and has always been a place to test stuff etc, and I need to clean it up.

## Features
* FiveM Server status and player count on command
* Full server moderation (ban/kick/mute/warn)
* Twitch stream announcements for verified streamers
* Bunch of custom utilities 
* Logging of a lot of stuff (deleted/edited messages, new members)
* Ability to retrieve FiveM player steam hex and name using their ID

## Pull requests
If you have any idea/suggestions, feel free to put in a request and I'll see whether its possible. I would ofcourse also like to hear any issues if you find any. If you find anything that will somehow kill the bot, please message me in Discord PM @0203#0203 to prevent PR of a very important issue.

## More info
The bot uses:
* [Discord.py Rewrite](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/)
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
